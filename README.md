### 2D OHT
## The author of this repository is Jiong Zhu.

This repository contains data related to the use of IES inversion, including reference random fields and 100 initial random fields generated for a two-dimensional OHT model.

The data is shared as part of a submission to the Water Resources Research (WRR) journal. The DOI will be updated following publication.

The two-dimensional heterogeneous OHT model was implemented using the variably saturated flow finite element model VSAFT2 (Yeh et al., 1993), available at: http://tian.hwr.arizona.edu/downloads.

If any parts of the data are used or reproduced the original source and the author must be cited.

Any questions can be addressed to the author @zhujiong@whu.edu.cn.
